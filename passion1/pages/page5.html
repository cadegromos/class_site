  <h1>Colors and Molds</h1>

  <p>After their transition from wood to plastic in the late 1940's, Lego began to use pneumatic injection molding machines to make its pieces. In 2004 Danish <br> mathematics professor, Søren Ejlers calculated that the number of unique ways you can combine six 2×4 LEGO bricks of the same colour is 915,103,765. Today the company <br> has over 7,000 individual molds, creating truly endless possibilities for building.</p>

  <p> When the company began, their users were limited to just 7 colors (white, gray, black, red, blue, yellow, and occasionally green). Their palette has expanded <br> over time and now features 65 colors. An updated chart is shown below. </p>
