  <h1>The Origins of Lego</h1>

  <p>The name ‘LEGO’ is an abbreviation of the two Danish words “leg godt”, meaning “play well”. The company has since used this term as their brand identity.</p>

  <p>The LEGO Group was founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen. over the last 90 years the company has been passed down from father to son and is now owned by Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, a grandchild of the founder.
  </p>

  <p>Originally beginning in a small carpenter’s workshop, the company has grown into a modern, global enterprise that is now one of the world’s largest manufacturers of toys.
