  <h1>The Classic Brick</h1>

  <p>The brick is our Lego's most recognizable product. Over the last 90 years the company has been named “Toy of the Century” twice. Their products have undergone <br> extensive development over the years – but the foundation of every product still remains the traditional Lego brick.</p>

  <p>The brick in its current form was launched in 1958. The brick features a unique interlocking principle that offers amazing building possibilities. The company has stated that <br> from there its just a "matter of getting the imagination going – and letting a wealth of creative ideas emerge through play."
